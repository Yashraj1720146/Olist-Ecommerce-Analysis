# Olist E-commerce Analysis

This is my analysis of the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset. I wanted to dig into the data to understand their sales, customers, and delivery performance.

The project was built with Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## What I Found

* **Top Products:** The `bed_bath_table` category is by far the most popular. However, categories like `watches_gifts` are also important because their average price is much higher.

* **Customer Hotspots:** Unsurprisingly, SÃ£o Paulo (SP) is the biggest market. It has more customers than the next two states (RJ and MG) combined.

* **Delivery Times:** There's a huge difference in delivery performance across the country. Customers in some northern states wait over three weeks longer on average for their orders compared to those in the southeast.


## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Plotly (for interactive charts)
